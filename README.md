A simple two-player for building AIs. HAGS, short for Hide And Go Seek, is a game of flashlight tag where two players compete to first get the flashlight, then shine it on the other player. By extending the HumanPlayer class, you can create an AI to play for you.

To see the full rulebook , see the HAGS [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14NR-Dluez_QUtO1ore0HOECqkKVwrAi2c2KDI7utido/edit?usp=sharing). HAGS was built for my EPGY class studying artificial intelligence.
